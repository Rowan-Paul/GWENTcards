# GWENTcards

This is a project based upon http://www.gwentcards.com/ made using MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS. The idea is to get feature parity with the original site on a faster, responsive website

The API that gets used is available in the [Rowan-Paul/gwentapi](https://github.com/Rowan-Paul/gwentapi) repository.

## Installation

You can run this app locally by running `npm install` and then `npm start`. There are redux action and reducer tests which can be run by running `npm test` in your terminal. You can get the coverage of the files by running `npm run coverage`.

The app also has ESLint and Prettier configurations from @imaginary-cloud. You can run the linter by running `npm run lint` and fix the errors by running `npm run lint:fix`.
